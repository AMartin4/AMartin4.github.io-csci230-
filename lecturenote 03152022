C Program vs. Java Programs
fast, prerequisite is low

Java is slow, requires OS + Java virtual machine. Not good for small devices 

C program directly manipulate memory 

Two-edge sword: powerful but insecure //C

int main()
{
	int a = 0;
	int *p = &a;
	printf ("%d", (long)(p));
	return 0;
}


int * p = &a;

Declare a pointer-type of variable named p, and intialize to the address of variable a
In a declaration, "*" stands for "pointer-type"
Afterwards, "*" , means "de-reference", retrieving the value at the memory location, using the syntax *p 


p = (int*)malloc(100*size
equivalent to java's
p = new int[100]
